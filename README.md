# CracklePop FizzBuzz KidzBop

I've included two exercises here one in JavaScript in the js directory and one in Haskell in the hs directory.

I had a lot of fun with the JavaScript version, especially with minifying.  Though I must admit drawing some inspiration from a similar iterative version (https://codeburst.io/javascript-breaking-down-the-shortest-possible-fizzbuzz-answer-94a0ad9d128a)

I am more confident with JavaScript as I've used it more than Haskell, but because I was curious I pieced together a solution as a learning opportunity that can be run in GHC.

## How to Run Javascript Version (or Bookmarklet)

The JavaScript solution can be run as a bookmarklet or online using jsfiddle

TO RUN IN A JS INTERPRETER
1. Copy and Paste the raw contents of js/cracklepop.min.js into a JavaScript Shell (like [JSFiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net/))

2. Hit Enter or Click Run and Bask in the glorious world of Crackles, Pops, and CracklePops.


TO RUN AS A BOOKMARKLET
1. Copy the raw bookmarklet code from js/bookmarklet

2. In your browser of choice navigate to create a new bookmark manually

3. Paste the copied contents of the js/bookmarklet file into the URL part of the new bookmark.

4. Navigate to a website that does NOT have a Content Security Policy limiting the execution of this script (recurse.com works well)

## How to Run Haskell Version (Tested with GHC 8.0.1 on Debian)

Depends:
```ghc```

1. Download hs/cracklepop.hs 

2. Compile with ```ghc``` & Run

3. No you aren't in the Matrix, thats just a side effect [Bad Haskell Joke]
