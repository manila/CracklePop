# CracklePop FizzBuzz KidzBop

I've included two exercises here one in JavaScript in the js directory and one in Haskell in the hs directory.

I suggest the JavaScript version as it is not only more recent but I feel it is a more complete solution.

I am more confident with JavaScript as I've used it more than Haskell, but because I was curious I pieced together a solution as a learning opportunity that can be run in GHC.

## How to Run Javascript Version (Bookmarklet)

The JavaScript solution can be run in the browser.
NOTE: this will NOT work on any website what has a Content Security Policy in place that limits this browser behavior. I've found that recusecenter.com will work well.

1. Copy the bookmarklet raw code and paste into the browser url bar.

2. Bask in the glorious world of Crackles, Pops, and CracklePops.

## How to Run Haskell Version (Tested in GHC)

1. Copy raw Haskell Code from the hs/cracklepop.hs

2. Paste into GHC, Press Enter

3. No you aren't in the Matrix, thats just a side effect [Bad Haskell Joke]
